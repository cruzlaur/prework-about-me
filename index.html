      <h1>Introduction</h1>>
      <p>I am very excited to take this coding bootcamp.  I am intrigued about learning more in this space and making a career change.  My professional experience is in Corporate Finance and analytics.  I hope to use that knowledge and skillset to  be successful in coding and hopefully leverage this to start my own digital marketing business.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in the Bronx, NY.  My family is from Morovis, Puerto Rico.  And I grew up in northern NJ. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies are spending time with my family and puppy Leo, traveling, dancing, learning new skill sets, jigsaw puzzles, and binge watching Netflix shows. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be a super successful entrepreneur with my own digital marketing agency.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Fort Lee, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My professional background is in Corporate Finance.  I spend a lot of time doing analytics in excel and translating them into insights for the business to make future decisions on.  Now that I work at a CPG company and get to see Marketing close up, itâ€™s always intrigued me and I want to make a career switch. I did my bachelors in Marketing and Finance but just ended up in Corporate Finance after school.  I think my analytical skills will lend nicely to learning coding.  I hope to use these skills to slowly start my own digital marketing business, inclusive of web development.</p>
